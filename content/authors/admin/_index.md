I am a Research Fellow at the Durrell Institute of Ecology and Conservation (DICE), University of Kent. My research broadly centres on the environmental and human dimensions of natural resource management in the forest tropics and further seeks to understand the interventions, actions, and processes that lead towards more just and sustainable futures.

My current research interests cover two broad domains:

- Supporting land-use decisions and interventions that advance sustainability goals, particularly in the context of mining and community forestry.

- Investigating the human dimensions of tropical forest and aquatic ecosystems and its importance in sustainable food systems.

As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am also interested in exploring different types of methods to generate diverse evidence to address complex sustainability challenges.

I am actively involved in several Equity & Diversity initiatives that aim to address the unequal barriers and risks in fieldwork, academia, and the broader environmental sector, including: Member of the Equity Advisory Working Group (EDWG) for the British Ecological Society (BES) and steering Committee member for the Equity and Diversity for all Genders in Ecology Gender Network (EDGE), BES.
