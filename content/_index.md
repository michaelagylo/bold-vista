        My research projects covers four broad domains:

        - **Impact evaluation.** I apply impact evaluation methods to inform land-use decisions and interventions that advance sustainability goals. My current research focuses on assessing the role of *Community Forestry* (*Perhutanan Sosial*) in achieving environmental and social objectives in Indonesia. Previously, I have used similar approaches to [quantify the impact of nickel mining](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(24)00534-7) on deforestation and on the well-being of local communities in Sulawesi, Indonesia.  

        - **Foodscapes.** How can more relational, place-based, and context-sensitive perspectives help build healthier, more sustainable, and equitable food systems? Through the [Foodscapes project](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/dice/2025/06/18/into-the-foodscapes-how-fishers-and-food-connect/), I explore how diverse communitiesâ€”particularly those often excluded from decision-makingâ€”experience, perceive, and navigate food systems. Using the concept of *foodscapes*, I seek to illuminate these perspectives, emphasising the importance of centering local experiences to understand how people relate to food and how such engagements can shape pathways toward more desirable futures. 

        - **Sustainability of food systems.** I have a long-standing interest in the "food security and forests" debate and the trade-offs it entails, highlighting the complexity of these interactions. My research spans multiple contexts, including oil palm landscapes and the interface between tropical forests and aquatic ecosystems, and their implications for sustainable food systems. For example, I led a systematic literature review examining the influence of [forests on freshwater fish in the tropics](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biaa021), and further assess its implications for food security and nutrition, with [Nigeria as a case study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218038). I have also investigated the contributions of [mangroves to fish consumption in Indonesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519623001961), and what implications this has for environmental conservation and food security outcomes.
    
        - **Methodological diversity.** As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am interested in exploring a wide range of methods to generate diverse forms of evidence for addressing complex sustainability challenges. In particular, I am keen to examine the role of *Participatory Visual Methods* in producing types of knowledge that are often difficult to capture through conventional approaches, and in engaging different audiences, especially those beyond the academic sphere. I am also interested in how we can better co-produce knowledge that is both meaningful and applicable, and in developing stronger interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to research.
