        My current research interests cover two broad domains:

        - Supporting land-use decisions and interventions that advance sustainability goals, particularly in the context of mining and community forestry.

        - Investigating the human dimensions of tropical forest and aquatic ecosystems and its importance in sustainable food systems.

        As an interdisciplinary researcher, I am also interested in exploring different types of methods to generate diverse evidence to address complex sustainability challenges.
